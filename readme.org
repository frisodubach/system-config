NixOS system configuration based on flakes & a simple module-folder structure. The configuration is based on that of [[https://github.com/mdvmeijer/system-config/][mdvmeijer]], expect for it's more simple in nature.
This is my first year of using Nix, and my use-case is not very complicated, so ease of use and simplicity are primarily important.

[[./showcase.png]]
* Overview
The configuration is split up in two main directories:
- =./hosts=
- =./modules=

Many Nix configurations I've seen are split up between =home-manager= and 'normal'-configuration. I instead like to organise things purely based on functionality.
In =./hosts= system configuration is defined. This should be specific for each system the Nix configuration is used on (currently just one system).
In =./modules= system capabilities are defined, mainly user-specific setup and =home-manager= configured programs / dotfiles. Contained in here is configuration of my most used programs such as:
- Hyprland
- Wofi
- EWW
- fish
- alacritty

There are also a few currently un-used programs included, these I either used before and have since switched away from, or a work in progress. I keep these in for completeness-sake and I don't want to bother with excluding them from the =.gitignore=.
For my config, I emphasise using standard dotfiles when convenient, to allow for anyone to copy my configuration, and make it easy to move away from NixOS should I ever want to (although I doubt it).

My =doom-emacs= configuration is not managed by Nix, and can instead be found [[https://github.com/frisodubach/nixConfig][here]], although I need to rework the repo to only include my doom-config.
* Work in progress
While my current configuration is quite okay to use right now, there are still some things that are on my list to fix. Right now this is:
- [-] Battery/Power management for laptop. (Configure =tlp= or =auto-cpufreq=)
  - [X] =tlp= configuration
  - [ ] =auto-cpufreq= usage/configuration
- [ ] =eww= improvements/clean-up
  - [ ] Get workspace widget working on =eww= bar.
  - [ ] Clean-up redundant files and folder structure
- [ ] Get a working =starship= configuration
- [ ] Split up the =hyprland=  module into smaller parts
- [-] Scripts clean-up
  - [X] Move out of =eww= module
  - [X] add to path
  - [X] Create desktop file for convenient use w/ rofi
  - [ ] Create airplane-mode script
  - [ ] Create rofi script for tlp management
- [X] Improve =hyprland= configuration ease-of-use. Maybe utilize scratchpad functionality, update / add keyboard shortcuts
  - [X] Improve multi-monitor workspace configuration
  - [X] Improve laptop monitor behaviour
- [ ] Move home-manager to flake (mdvmeijer)
- [ ] Configure Doom Emacs with home-manager
- [ ] Add doom folder to path or make environment variable (mdvmeijer)
* Aspirational
Things I would really like to implement:
- [ ] Caffeine widget in eww-bar
- [X] Bluetooth control menu
- [ ] Microphone control menu
- [ ] Implement nix variables for color scheme
- [ ] =firefox= / =librewolf= configuration w/ Nix
- [X] Bluetooth setup & =eww= widget
- [ ] Zatuhra configuration
- [ ] qutebrowser
- [ ] Find & use more terminal applications to replace GUI applications (music-player, file-browser, etc)
- [ ] Configure =borg= backups
- [X] =mullvad= script for wofi to switch locations
